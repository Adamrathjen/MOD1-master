# Overview

This program is a character creator for a game of my own desgin. The choices of the
player are the foundation of the game, this software forms the very beginning of 
the players experience in a world where the sky's the limit.

I made this program to learn Python and have that knowledge in hand and on my resume.
I also wanted to start programming some of the features of a game I am working on. 
While this is a very small step in working on my very own game, it was a huge step
in learning how Pythn works.

# Development Environment

I did this all in Virtual Studio Code
I used Python 3.9 to do everthing in this program 
I included the os library for file handling
I included the json library to store and read a dictionary

# Future Work

* I need to populate the stat block of the character based on their choices
* I need to tweak the read file function to display the choices they made rather than the numbers to mark their choices
* I need to create the character inventory and skill blocks
* I need to expand the options available to include multiple pedastle choices, attribute affinities, and how they determine the stats of the character.
